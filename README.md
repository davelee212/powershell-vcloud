# powershell-vcloud

Some scripts I put together while working with vCloud Director.

The scripts to do with vSE and vApp were written specifically for a DR project in vCloud Director where vShield firewalls were used in production and had to be brought up at failover time in the DR site (due to the one vApps are replicated using Zerto).

These were tested on vCloud Director v5.6.4 (the first of the Service Provider branch) but not on more recent versions.
